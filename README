Set-Functional - set operations for functional programming

This module provides basic set operations for native lists.  The primary goal
is to take advantage of Perl's native functional programming capabilities
while relying solely on Pure Perl constructs to perform the set operations as
fast as possible.  All of these techniques have been benchmarked against other
common Perl idioms to determine the optimal solution.  These benchmarks can
be found in this package (shortly).

Each function is provided in two forms.  The first form always expects simple
flat data structures of defined elements.  The second form expects a BLOCK
to evaluate each member of the list to a defined value to determine how the
element is a set member.  These can be identified by the suffix "_by".  None
of these functions check definedness inline so as to eliminate the costly
O(n) operation.  All functions have been prototyped to give them a native
Perl-ish look and feel.
